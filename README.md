Architecture + The Internet of Things // MIT
'Ambient Lamp'

==

Todo

	- Create a physical interface for the 3 states // I would say digital over REST framework//server but I think the beauty of this lamp is that it uses this advanced technology, but you would never know!
	
	- Solve the rotation issue // how to embed, or sense the lamps position?

	- Resolve the lampShade -laser cut paper + frame --> needs all sides!

	- Eventually, deal with REST client for Yun

	- Consider switching between different data points
		I suppose it really is just a traditionally adapted 'ambient orb'
		Does it matter that this item sort of senses?
		YES HAPTIC --> This is personal

	- Along with the data points comes an application interface to asking the lamp questions
		Along with receiving responsed to these questions, come increasingly sophistocated interactions. How will the lamp awknowledge that it is switching data types, or responding to input.

		You can solve this, just think about the ways that people interact! : ]

	- Change locations on the fly with the REST interface

	- Parse your new JSON Object

	- Want to wrap your HTML request inside of a function // asynchronous
