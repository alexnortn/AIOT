Architecture + The Internet of Things // MIT
'Ambient Lamp'

==

Todo

	- Create a physical interface for the 3 states // I would say digital over REST framework//server but I think the beauty of this lamp is that it uses this advanced technology, but you would never know!
	
	- Solve the rotation issue // how to embed, or sense the lamps position?

	- Resolve the lampShade -laser cut paper + frame --> needs all sides!

	- Eventually, deal with REST client for Yun

	- Consider switching between different data points
		I suppose it really is just a traditionally adapted 'ambient orb'
		Does it matter that this item sort of senses?
		YES HAPTIC --> This is personal

	- Along with the data points comes an application interface to asking the lamp questions
		Along with receiving responsed to these questions, come increasingly sophistocated interactions. How will the lamp awknowledge that it is switching data types, or responding to input.

		You can solve this, just think about the ways that people interact! : ]

	- Change locations on the fly with the REST interface

	- Parse your new JSON Object

	- Want to wrap your HTML request inside of a function // asynchronous

	Your app will now run off of the 'Weather Underground' app due to a lack of usefullness from Yahoo.
	This is your api key:
		9867e8006f7cddb7

	With WeatherUnderground it is possible to retrieve:
		10Dayforecast
		Also, a forecast tailored to unique coordinates
		http://api.wunderground.com/api/9867e8006f7cddb7/geolookup/q/37.776289,-122.395234.json

	Could the lamp learn?
		What about training this thing?
		Could it adapt to the users habits?
		Y knot..
		Qualitative adaption..?
		Don't forget the color..

	There is beauty in training something as simple as this lamp
		Embedding technology really elegantly into really elegant objects.
		Objects that learn- learn the way that we learn.
		Damn.. no you can really do this.


	The lamp is a single componet of your workspace.. could you create a system of systems that learns your habits in the sense that it adapts to the ways that you use the space..
		That's degree project worthy!

	Probably learn to link this all together in a google spreadsheet! That way we have a nice log file setup.
